# Midterm | Web Design I | Art Department | Queens College

You’re tasked with creating the designs for your own portfolio web site (which you’ll implement in HTML and CSS as your final project). This requires your having to compile the content that you want to present to your audience, including text, images, audio, and/or video; compartmentalize your content and create wireframes, using a grid to create a visual rhythm; and, implement digital designs. Your wireframes and designs need to be compiled into a digital presentation, submitted via GitHub, and delivered to the class on the midterm date. Each of these steps is discussed below.

## 1. Content

Prepare the content for your site. This will likely include information about who you are, how to get in touch with you, social media data, which portfolio pieces you plan to include, what you’ll say about each piece, any press you’ve received, any exhibitions you’d been a part of, your education, a picture of you, and anything else you think will enhance your portfolio. **No ipsum, or filler, content can be used.**

In preparing your content, look at portfolios from other artists and designer. Also, look at the work of undergraduate, graduate, and alumni from other design programs, such as RISD, SCAD, Cal Arts, Pratt, SVA, Parsons, Yale School of Art, and Royal College of Art. These will also give you design ideas for step 3 below.

## 2. Wireframes and Grids

Once you’ve settled on the content of your portfolio site, you’ll need to “frame,” or wireframe, it. This means you’ll draw containers that represent sections of your site.

This is also the stage in the development of your project where you decide on overall container sizes and grid dimensions. For example, you may choose a 1024-pixel container for desktop, a 768-pixel container for tablet, and a 320-pixel container for mobile, all comprised of 80-pixel units (60-pixel column + 20-pixel gutter).

To implement your wireframes, or wires, you may use Balsamiq Mockups, InDesign, Photoshop, Sketch, or any other digital tool that allows you to create rectangular containers. You may also take the analog path: paper and pencil. If you do, you’ll need to take pictures of your drawings.

Whether you go digital or analog for your wires, you’ll need to create one wire per device (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

To get started, search the web for terms such as “wireframe ideas” and “wireframe examples.”

## 3. Designs

Just like your wires were informed by your content, your designs will be informed by your wires. You’ll need to lay a design “over” your wires for each page of your site. For example, if you create a home page, an *about me* page, a *contact* page, and a *portfolio* page, you’ll need to render desktop, tablet, and mobile pages for each page, totally twelve designs.

The grid you settle on in step 2 should be used as the basis for the layout of all your content in this step.

## 4. Presentation

With your wires and designs in place, compile your presentation as a PDF file called `presentation.pdf` or a Keynote file called `presentation.key` that showcases your wires and designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Make certain to show one grid for desktop, tablet, and mobile renderings.

**Important note**: Ensure that, as you render individual pages, each page is as small in size as possible, because your final presentation file *must* be no larger than 5MB in size.

See the **Submission** section below for instructions on how to include your project in this repo for submission.
